# Overview

In NYS, Epi Locator is deployed by its original name, CT Assist.

## Contact Tracer Workflow

As a contact tracer ("CT") works on cases in CommCare, they may find a patient case
is missing full and/or accurate contact information. From the Case Investigation
form, the CT can click the "Search CT Assist for phone and address" link which will
open Epi Locator in a new browser tab and perform a search against the Thomson Reuters ("TR")
[CLEAR S2S API](https://developerportal.thomsonreuters.com/clear-system-system). The CT
can then copy relevant contact information from Epi Locator into their clipboard, then
into CommCare. Epi Locator does not write data to CommCare.

## Integration with CommCare

Epi Locator authenticates with CommCare by verifying an HMAC signature that is passed
from CommCare to Epi Locator by a `form POST`. Please see the CommCare [source 
code](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/blob/74bc31910f692126f03c46a350ab8ae5700f87dd/corehq/apps/integration/static/integration/js/hmac_callout.js) 
for their implementation. Epi Locator mirrors this implementation locally for development purposes in the 
  [commcare_signature.html.eex](https://github.com/RatioPBC/epi-locator/blob/main/lib/epi_locator_web/templates/page/commcare_signature.html.eex) template.

The signature is verified in `EpiLocatorWeb.Plugs.RequireValidSignature` with `EpiLocator.Signature.valid?/3`. 
We store the signature in a cache in `EpiLocator.Signature.Cache` and reject any signatures that have
already been used.

If the signature is valid, Epi Locator performs a search through cache to the TR CLEAR S2S API.
Because TR charges per query, we store results from previous queries in our cache to
minimize costs. If a cache entry for a query doesn't already exist, we make an API request and store
the results.

## CLEAR S2S API Integration

In order to make requests against the CLEAR S2S API, one must ask TR to provision a certificate
that is used to sign HTTP requests to the API. They will send a `PFX` file, which will need the certificates 
extracted via the following command:

```
openssl pkcs12 -in input.pfx -out certificate.cer -nodes
```

The result file contains a key and 2 certificates. The first certificate in the cert chain will need all the newlines converted to literal `\n`
characters and made available to the application via environment variables:

```
THOMSON_REUTERS_BASIC_AUTH
THOMSON_REUTERS_CERT_PASSWORD
THOMSON_REUTERS_API_ENDPOINT
THOMSON_REUTERS_PRIVATE_KEY
THOMSON_REUTERS_PUBLIC_CERT
```

See `EpiLocator.ThomsonReuters.Config` for more details. Each time a query is made, a 
`EpiLocator.QueryResultLog` is stored with stats relevant to the query. These stats can be accessed
through the admin login, where one can download all entries or monthly summaries.

## Refining Search Results

CTs have the ability, when presented with multiple search results, to refine the results.

Each time the results are refined, a `EpiLocator.RefinementLog` is stored with stats relevant
to the specific refinement. These stats can be access through the admin login, where one can
download all entries or monthly summaries.

## Performance

75% of requests to the CLEAR S2S API are returned within 700-1000 ms.
