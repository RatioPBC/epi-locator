# Epi Locator

Epi Locator is a software application designed to help case
investigation and contact tracing teams more easily find missing contact
information for positive COVID-19 cases and their contacts, enabling
public health teams to reach more individuals in less time. Epi Locator
integrates with a case management system, enabling users to search data
enrichment sources for missing contact information directly within the
case management system. Users have reported that a tool like this (i.e.,
contact enrichment fully integrated into a case management system) is
especially helpful in the context of a high-volume of cases, as seen
during surges of COVID-19 cases.

Epi Locator is deployed in production for the New York State Department
of Health and the New Jersey Department of Health. It is currently
integrated with contact tracing systems built on
[CommCare](https://dimagi.com/commcare/) from [Dimagi](https://dimagi.com/),
as well as the Thomson Reuters CLEAR API.

The development of Epi Locator is sponsored by [Resolve to Save Lives,
an initiative of Vital
Strategies](https://resolvetosavelives.org/).

code should be able to download it and run the test suite. The software
is being actively developed on MacOS and Linux.
